VBA Homework Assignment

I was able to get some of the Moderate Solution options to work on the 2016 Worksheet.  However, I fould that I could not figure out how to get conditional formatting to work within the code and I also ran into division by zero error on the 2014 & 2015 Worksheets.  I've seen the solutions because the ones I've seen involve IF statements, I could not determine where to work in the additional code.  I certianly tried but I've decided it's not worth my time to invest more time in VBA vs. reviewing all the new Python material.
